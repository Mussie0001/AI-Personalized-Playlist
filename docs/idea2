# Our AI-Generated Spotify Playlists project will leverage cloud-based storage like Google Cloud or AWS to efficiently manage user preferences and generated playlists due to the unpredictable volumes of audio files & storing playlists. OpenAI's API will analyze user-provided favorite artists or songs and generate personalized song recommendations. These AI-generated suggestions will then be seamlessly integrated with the Spotify API to access song data and create dynamic playlists for users. To ensure user security and privacy, we will implement robust third-party authentication mechanisms, allowing users to authenticate using their existing Spotify credentials. Our system will embrace a decoupled architecture, featuring a responsive front-end developed using JavaScript (React) for user interactions, and a back-end by Node.js and Express.js for RESTful API operations.
