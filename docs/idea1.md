# Our Playlist Transfer Service project will leverage a robust and scalable tech stack to achieve its goals. We will implement a cloud-based database (AWS) to store user profiles and cache data, ensuring efficient playlist transfer operations (or PostgreSQL if volume is on the low end). We will integrate the Spotify and Apple Music APIs to access user playlists and music data, enabling seamless interaction with these music streaming platforms. Additionally, for user authentication and authorization, we will employ OAuth-based third-party authentication, allowing users to log in with their existing Spotify or Apple Music accounts. To ensure a decoupled architecture, the project will consist of a front-end built using JavaScript (probably React) for a responsive user interface, and a back-end powered by Node.js and Express.js to handle RESTful API requests.
